## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not use any outside souces, I used eveything that was provided to me. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? 
some of the challenges while working on this submisson that I faced was working on code that i did not really understand. However by reading more into it and doing a bit of research I was able to understand how to code a bit of javascript and css. Im still a bit unsure on some parts of the javascript such as the code in the playTone function and startTone. However I am hopping to understand it more as I get more experience in Coding in javaScript. after noticing that it is a bit like C++ in a way, i figured out how to impliemnt it so that when 3 mistakes were made then it the gameover screen would pop up. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 
Some questions that I have about web developer is this how most websites written with javascript, css and html? and how do websites connenet to severs in order to save information? also how do web developer remember all of these syntax of coding these differerent coding languages ? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. 
if I had I few more hours I would use it to research on how to make a score tracker to keep the score and to keep the memory game infinitely. I would also need to make the patters random instead of a static, so it can change everytime someone plays the game instead of repeating the same pattern.
